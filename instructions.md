# **Technical Assessment: Fullstack Engineering Challenge**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the technical assessment round\! In this challenge, you'll build a
small fullstack application that demonstrates your ability to design, implement,
and structure a modern web application with a cloud-native backend.

The goal is to complete the core requirements within a limited timeâ€”weâ€™re more
interested in your approach, architecture, and code quality than perfection.

## **Project: Medication Management App**

You will build a simple Medication Manager that allows a caregiver to:

- Add a medication for a care recipient.
- Define a schedule for when the medication should be taken.
- View a list of upcoming medication doses.
- Mark a medication as taken.

### **Business Requirements**

- Each medication must have at least one scheduled dose.
- Medications cannot be removed, only marked as inactive.
- Medication schedules must support both daily and weekly recurrence.

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Backend**

- Develop a service using AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway
- Use TypeScript for development.
- Data should be persisted, but you can choose the approach (include information
  in the readme if you want to explain your reasoning, DynamoDB, RDS)

### **Frontend**

- Build a React-based front end.
- Display a list of medications with upcoming doses.
- Allow caregivers to add new medications and view schedules.
- Include a simple UI for marking doses as taken.

### **Additional Requirements**

- Error Handling: Provide descriptive error messages and appropriate HTTP status
  codes.
- Testing: Implement unit tests for core business logic. Mock your DB
  implementation in tests where appropriate.
- Deployment: Make the service deployable using serverless frameworks
- Authentication: Include a simple authentication mechanism (e.g., basic auth or
  API key) to secure the endpoints.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Code Structure & Readability**: Is your code modular, maintainable, and
  clear?
- **API Design**: Is the backend well-structured and easy to understand?
- **Data Handling**: Are medications and schedules stored and retrieved
  correctly?
- **UI/UX**: Does the frontend provide a smooth and intuitive user experience?
- **Executable:** Do you provide instructions with a simple way for a reviewer
  to run your app and test functionality?

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Commit the code to a public GitHub repository.
- Include a `README` with setup instructions.
  - If you need to cut scope, justify what features you prioritized and what you
    cut
  - Steps to run tests if included
  - Bonus: write up on design choice and trade-offs

## **Time Limit**

This assignment should be accomplished and submitted within **one week** of
receiving these instructions. If you need to reduce scope, document what you
deprioritized and why.

Good luck, and happy coding\! ðŸš€
